# odin-testing_practice

This is the seventeenth project to work in the "JavaScript Course"

## The experience I get in this project

(2025/07/19) I complete this project with knowledges of JavaScript I learned in the previous course. I use Javascript concepts such as array, module, Test-Driven Development(TDD), to build a testing file and other functions to test functions in `function.js`. With advices in Assignment of the project, I try use the TDD pattern of Triangulate to design the functions, verify the results, and modify functions repeatedly. I successfully design 5 different functions with the Red-Green-Refactor process step by step. Futhermore, I use npm command to run and debug my tests in `function.test.js`. This activity strengthens my skills in JavaScript.
